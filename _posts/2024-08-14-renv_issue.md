When working with R and `renv` to manage project dependencies, you might encounter issues during package installation, particularly when using a Conda environment. In this post, I’ll walk through a problem I faced when trying to install the Bioconductor package `limma` and the steps I took to resolve it.

### The Problem: Installation Failure with `renv`

While attempting to install the `limma` package using `renv`, I encountered an error during the installation process. Here’s the full output of the issue:

```r
> renv::install("bioc::limma")
# Downloading packages -------------------------------------------------------
- Downloading limma from BioCsoft ...           OK [file is up to date]
Successfully downloaded 1 package in 0.1 seconds.

The following package(s) will be installed:
- limma [3.60.4]
These packages will be installed into "/data/projects/240814_Popzhelyazkova_Bremer_Neuropathologie_DNAmArray/analysis/renv/library/linux-ubuntu-jammy/R-4.4/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu".

Do you want to proceed? [Y/n]: Y

```

### Diagnosing the Issue

The error message indicates that the installation failed because the compiler (`x86_64-conda-linux-gnu-cc`) could not be found. This pointed to a problem with the system's `PATH` environment variable.

When I checked the `PATH` using:

```r
> Sys.getenv("PATH")
[1] "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin:/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/quarto/bin:/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/postback"
```

I realized that the path to the Conda environment’s binary directory (`/opt/miniconda3/envs/R4.4.1/bin/`) was missing. This meant that the necessary compiler, which was installed in the Conda environment, was not available to RStudio, leading to the failure.

### The Solution: Updating the `PATH` Variable

To resolve this, I needed to add the Conda environment’s binary directory to the `PATH` within R. This can be done temporarily for the current session using the `Sys.setenv()` function:

```r
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste("/opt/miniconda3/envs/R4.4.1/bin", Sys.getenv("PATH"), sep = ":"))
```

After updating the `PATH`, I retried the package installation:

```r
renv::install("bioc::limma")
```

This time, the installation proceeded without any issues.

### Conclusion

If you encounter similar issues when installing packages with `renv` in RStudio, especially within a Conda environment, make sure the relevant binaries are accessible by checking and updating your `PATH`. This simple adjustment can save you from installation headaches and keep your R projects running smoothly.
