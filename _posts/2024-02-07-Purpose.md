It has been a while for considering to begin this blog under the title Genomics AI. After years of diving into Genomics research, I found the best way and the only way to fully reveal the underneath networks in genomics. This blog will have multiple purposes as below:

- My personal reflects in life and career.
- Recording the development of my personal projects.
- Sharing the new knowledges and technologies from academics.
- Storing the tutorials I made for bioinformatics analyses.
- Listing useful resources in everything I learn.

Below is the potential categories I aim to cover:

- Notes
  - Bioinformatics tools
  - R
  - Python
  - Shell
  - Single cell sequencing analyses
  - Tensorflow

- Tutorials

- Reports
  - Genomics
  - Datasets
  - Computational methods

- Projects
  - lncRNAexp
  - GPM
  - Genomkit

- Tips
  - Bioinformatics Tips
  - Data Analysis Tips
  - Programming Tips
  - Research Tips

- Knowledge

- Personal
