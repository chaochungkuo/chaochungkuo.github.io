## lncRNAexp

This project aims to train a deep learning model to predict the expression of protein-coding genes from lncRNAs. This model will be applied to each lncRNA for exploring their potential functions as well as the hidden mechanisms.

## [GenomKit](https://github.com/chaochungkuo/Genomkit)

Genomkit is designed as a collection of modules and functions to handle various file types in bioinformatic analyses. Each file type in fact represents an aspect of the real biological networks. Just as a diamond has many facets, the real biological system has also many views according to the measurement methods.

## [GPM](https://github.com/chaochungkuo/GPM)

GPM (Genomic Project Manager) is a versatile command-line tool designed for managing and automating bioinformatic workflows. Key features include:

- End-to-End Workflow: Seamlessly manage demultiplexing, processing, analysis, interactive reporting, and archiving tasks.
- Customizable: Easily adapt GPM to your environment, computer, web service, institute, or specific author requirements.
- Comprehensive NGS Application Coverage: Covering a wide range of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) applications, including RNAseq, tRNAseq, mRNAseq, ChIPseq, ATACseq, CLIPseq, ampliseq, scRNAseq, scVDJseq, scATACseq, miRNAseq, BWGS, WES, 16S, MAG, and more.
- Ideal for Bioinformatics Services: A powerful tool for individuals providing bioinformatic services.
